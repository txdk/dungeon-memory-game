# Dungeon Memory Game

This project is a web game about memorising increasingly difficult button sequences to defeat various monsters as you delve deeper and deeper into some nondescript fantasy-world dungeon. The app is built in React using Vite, Typescript and Tailwind css, and deployed as a static webpage on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

To run the app in a local development environment, clone the repo then install the project dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/txdk/dungeon-memory-game.git
cd dungeon-memory-game
npm ci
```

Then run the development server
```sh
npm run dev
```

You will then be able to access the webapp by navigating to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.
